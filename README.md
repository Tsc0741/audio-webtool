# 🎵 AcoustiLearn

**Bridging Music and Acoustics Through Interactive Learning**

Interactive web tools that bridge the learning gap between perception-based sound study (music) and physics-based sound study (acoustics). Connect your musical intuition with scientific measurement for deeper understanding of sound.

## 🌉 Purpose

Traditional education treats music and acoustics as separate disciplines. AcoustiLearn creates a parallel learning track where musical concepts directly connect to their acoustic foundations, helping students understand how subjective musical experience relates to objective sound physics.

## 🛠️ Tools

### Sound Synthesis & Analysis
- **Harmonic Synthesizer** - Build complex timbres from fundamental frequencies and harmonics
- **Harmonic Analyzer** - Draw custom waveforms and see their Fourier analysis
- **STFT Analyzer** - Professional spectral analysis with customizable windows
- **Chord Harmonic Collision Tool** - Analyze harmonic interactions in musical chords using just intonation

### Psychoacoustic Testing
- **Frequency Difference Limen Test** - Measure your pitch discrimination threshold
- **Two Tones Discrimination Test** - Find your frequency resolution limits
- **Complex Tone Interval Test** - Rate harmony across different instrument timbres
- **Stereo Localization Test** - Test spatial hearing with delay and amplitude cues

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Music students** exploring the physics behind harmony
- **Physics students** making wave mechanics tangible through music
- **Audio engineers** connecting technical skills to musical intuition
- **Researchers** in psychoacoustics and music cognition
- **Educators** creating interdisciplinary sound courses
